## Introduction

Welcome to the Asam Beauty AI Product Advisor, a demonstration project showcasing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot. This prototype was developed to explore how AI can assist customers by providing information and advice on beauty products from the German cosmetics company, M. Asam. While other major German beauty retailers like DM offer chatbot experiences, this project aims to illustrate similar capabilities for M. Asam.

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate a practical application of various AWS services to build an intelligent, responsive, and responsible AI assistant. Key focuses include:

* **RAG Architecture:** Implementing a robust RAG pipeline to ensure answers are grounded in specific product information, thereby significantly mitigating model hallucination.
* **Responsible AI with Guardrails:** Utilizing Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to:
    * Filter potentially harmful or inappropriate user prompts and model responses.
    * Prevent the chatbot from providing medical advice.
    * Block the leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) if present in the source documents or generated by the model.
* **Multilingual Capabilities:** Leveraging a multilingual embedding model to enable interaction and information retrieval across different languages (though the primary demo content is German and English).
* **Cloud Deployment:** Demonstrating a serverless deployment on AWS.

**Example Questions to Try:**
*(The data that the chatbot has access to corresponds to a selection of 10 different face creams, with a broad range of features. Folder "product_descriptions" contains the dataset.)*

* *"What face creams do you recommend me for the night?"*
* *"Is the Vinolift line suitable for mature skin?"*
* *"I suffer from severe acne. Will your creams cure it?"* (Should be blocked, given that the guardrails forbid to discuss medical issues)
